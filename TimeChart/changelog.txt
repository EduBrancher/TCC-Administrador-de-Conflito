May 13th 2022:

Class added.

TimeChart is the core object of the application, representing a 7-day week in which days are divided
in 24-hour segments. Each of these segments may contain a set of Courses representing
which courses have a session in that particular hour. TimeChart also contains a set of students
representing all students on which we have enrollment data.

Setters: setCourseAtWindow(Course course, TimeWindow time_window)

Getters: getCoursesAtWindow(TimeWindow time_window), getStudents()

Constructor: TimeChart(set<Student> students)

Methods:
swapCourses(Course first_course, TimeWindow first_window, 
    Course second_course, TimeWindow second_window) swaps the two pairs in the chart.
findConflicts(std::set<Student> students, TimeWindow time_window) finds all conflicts in a given TimeWindow.

June 10th 2022:

Adds TimeChart.cpp for class implementation. Implements methods setCourseAtWindow, getCoursesAtWindow,
TimeChart constructor, getStudents and swapCourses. Uses the weekday modification introduced
at TimeWindow.

July 1st 2022:
Implements findConflicts.

July 15th 2022:
Changes findConflicts to use TimeWindow::clashes function and simpler logic.
