May 13th 2022:
Class added.

Course represents a particular class that will be given in this semester.
A course therefore has a name and id, and a set of TimeWindow that represents
when these classes will occur. Since TimeWindow contains both time and weekday,
this is sufficient to determine when all classes will occur.

Setters: None

Getters: getName, getId, getTimes

Constructor: Course(std::vector<TimeWindow> time_windows, std::string name, int id)

Methods: addTimeWindow(TimeWindow time_window), removeTimeWindow(TimeWindow time_window)

July 1st 2022:

Adds TimeWindow comparator (TWComparator) to the set's template variables. Changes
a Course's TimeWindow container to a set. (Courses may not have exactly the same window
repeated as that would imply 2 simultaneous classes at the same weekday and hours).

July 15th 2022:
Implements class. Creates a comparator class for courses and adds it to all sets of courses.
Adds a copy constructor and ID generator for comparison purposes, with a static object counter.
